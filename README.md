 We covered website functionality using DOM to connect Javascript and HTML with this Rock, Paper, Scissors game. Now the user can play directly on the screen instead of typing in a prompt and seeing the results in the console panel.

first version:

This is the first version of the Rock, Paper, Scissors project in The Odin Project web development course. Currently it is run out entirely in the console panel.

It is 5 rounds of rock, paper, scissors and it displays the reuslts after each round. At the end of 5 rounds (excluding ties), it will determine if you are the winner.
